## Group Project Overview
As part of group project for UoT's Data Analytics Bootcamp, our team chose to work on builidng a machine learning model which would predict the next upcoming restaurant to earn atleast one of the Michelin stars. All the team members felt that this would be an interesting topic and that it would help us put to use and explore the tools  we have learnt across this bootcamp. 

## Reasoning
Historically, Michelin star restaurants earn more profit as the inspection/screening process (by Michelin) is so elaborate and intense that the star adds hugh value to a restaurant earnig it. just a single Michelin star sends profits and footfalls soaring high and hence chefs are forever in the chase to earn these for their restauarnts. This means that such restaurants are potentially seeked out by investors and hence our group aims at helping out these investors find their next big investment. 

## Data source
The group decided to use 

## Goal
Determine which features adversly affect the decision to award a Michelin star. These features would be key indicators othat would be used to then help build our machine learning model. Select which model to use and train and test this data and use it to predict which restaurant could be awarded a Micheling star next.
