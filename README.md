## Group Project Overview
As part of our group project for UoT's Data Analytics Bootcamp, our team chose to work on builidng a machine learning model which would predict the next upcoming restaurant having the potential to earn atleast one of the Michelin 'stars'. All the team members felt that this would be an interesting topic and that it would help us put to good use the tools and concepts that we have learnt in this bootcamp.

## Reasoning
Michelin star restaurants earn more profit as the inspection/screening process is so elaborate and intense that the star adds high value to a restaurant. Just a single Michelin star sends profits and footfalls soaring high and hence chefs are forever in the chase to earn these stars for their restauarnt(s). This means that such restaurants are regularly seeked out by investors and hence our group aims at helping out these investors find their next big investment. 

## Data source
The group decided to use data sourced from Kaggle. For data cleaning and analysis: Jupyter will be used initially to clean and analyze data. In this we will use Numpy and Pandas to read file.

## Goal
Determine which features adversly affect the decision to award a Michelin star. These features would be key indicators that would be used to then help build our machine learning model. Select which model to use, train and test this data and use it to predict which restaurant could be awarded a Michelin star next.
