## Group Project Overview
As part of group project for UoT's Data Analytics Bootcamp, our team chose to work on builidng a machine learning model which would predict the next upcoming restaurant to earn atleast one of the Michelin 'stars'. All the team members felt that this would be an interesting topic and that it would help us put to good use the tools and learnings that we have worked with during this bootcamp. 

## Reasoning
Michelin star restaurants earn more profit as the inspection/screening process is so elaborate and intense that the star adds high value to a restaurant earnig it. just a single Michelin star sends profits and footfalls soaring high and hence chefs are forever in the chase to earn these stars for their restauarnt(s). This means that such restaurants are potentially seeked out by investors and hence our group aims at helping out these investors find their next big investment. 

## Data source
The group decided to use 

## Goal
Determine which features adversly affect the decision to award a Michelin star. These features would be key indicators othat would be used to then help build our machine learning model. Select which model to use and train and test this data and use it to predict which restaurant could be awarded a Micheling star next.
