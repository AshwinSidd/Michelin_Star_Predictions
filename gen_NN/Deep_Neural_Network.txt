# Applying Deep Neural Network 

A neural network will be used in the module with a certain amount of hidden layers and activation functions.

Based on the dataset the following is to be decided:
•	Target variable and features
•	Does any variable needs to be standardize
•	Does any category need binning?

Determine the metrics to be used in testing the robustness and performance of the model.
Can another model still be used and is logistic regression applicable
